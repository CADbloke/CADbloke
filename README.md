- **https://www.CADtoNetbox.com** automates CAD wiring drawings syncing with Netbox...
    - CAD to Netbox also includes my C# .NET Netbox API client generated from multiple versions of Netbox, not just from the YAML and not with SwaggerGen because that made an unholy mess. It is refined with info parsed from the Netbox source code. 
- **https://www.CableSchedules.com** automates the boring bits of broadcast system design - cable schedules, offsheets, labels...
- **https://www.CADreplace.com** - AutoCAD and BricsCAD FIND but good. Replaces multiple things in multiple drawings in one step

- :tv: Broadcast Systems Design and Documentation since last century
- :computer: Developing: AutoCAD plugins & CAD apps since 2005, in C#, Lisp & VBA (yeahnah)
- past lives include :movie_camera:, :camera:, :racing_car:+:video_camera:, :computer: in the 80s
